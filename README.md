Super Simple Python Command Interpreter

It's a really simple command interpreter that does some basic functions.
It was originally designed to work on my graphing calculator! It didn't really work out, but I'm still trying!
I'll be updating it occasionally.
Don't expect much though, as it's meant to run on (almost) everything. (And it's in very early development.)
There are some basic commands, type help for a list of them!
* Required libraries:
  * os
  * shutil
  * platform
  * cmd
